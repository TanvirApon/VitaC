Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an essential nutrient that supports numerous bodily functions. 
It is crucial for maintaining healthy skin, blood vessels, bones, and cartilage, primarily due to its role in collagen synthesis.
Collagen is a protein that provides structure to the skin and helps repair tissues, making Vitamin C important for wound healing. 
Additionally, it boosts the immune system by enhancing the activity of white blood cells, enabling the body to fight infections more effectively. 
Vitamin C also acts as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative damage.<span id="dots">...</span>

A severe deficiency can lead to scurvy, characterized by fatigue, bleeding gums, and poor wound healing.
