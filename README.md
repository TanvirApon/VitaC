# VitC - Single Page Application (SPA)

Welcome to **VitC**, a Single Page Application (SPA) that doesn't rely on any database connections. 
The website is created using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and a custom **index.js** file to handle dynamic DOM manipulations, 
including clicking interactions, name changes, color updates, and option selections.

- **Bootstrap 4** – For responsive design and components.
- **JavaScript** – For dynamic DOM manipulation and SPA interactions.
